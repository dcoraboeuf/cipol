cipol

cipol stands for Continuous Integration Policy and helps you to enforce a policy for your
commits in your organization. It works for both centralized (Subversion) and decentralized
(Git, Mercurial) SCM.

The policy administrator configures the policy using a Web interface and can set-up policies like:
* message formatting
* connection with issue tracking engines (JIRA, Trac...)
* ACL on edited paths
* ... (extensions can also be provided)

Policy is enforced at server and client side by providing hooks that connects to the cipol engine.

See the cipol wiki at https://github.com/dcoraboeuf/cipol/wiki for more information.
